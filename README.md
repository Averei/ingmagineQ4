Build an AI social media management app for small businesses, brands, or personnels. 

The app should have the following elements:
user uploaded content (images, videos, company logo, product photos, product manuals, event photos and videos, etc)
user profiling, mining of user data (profile, posts, uploaded contents)
AI generated content. What type of posts to generate at what time? How to generate? The generated content should be based on information mined from the user (industry, products, historical posts, time and date of the year, recent trends, etc).

Perform a research on this and propose a solution for this app. Write a small demo app showcasing some or all parts of your solution.
